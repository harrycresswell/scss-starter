# SCSS-Starter

This is a simple SCSS starter for building scalable sites with a focus on UI components.

The project follows a few principles:

## ITCSS
The folder structure is based on [ITCSS](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528), a methodology proposed by Harry Roberts. The main difference being the file structure isn't completely flat.

## Atomic Design
I've set up the components folder to follow [Brad Frost's Atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology.

## SUITCSS & BEM
The actual components are built using [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and [SUITCSS](https://github.com/suitcss) principles.
